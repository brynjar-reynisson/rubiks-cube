# rubiks-cube
Rubik's cube codification. There's a CubeModel for storing the cube's state and an Action enum for moving the sides and updating the cube.
A JavaFX application can display all sides of the cube, move the sides, scramble the cube and reset it.
Future enhancements may include solving a scrambled cube, and possibly loading an image of a scrambled cube.
